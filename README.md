This repo is about Java tutorials on HackerRank, and I will add important points of what I've learned.

IMPORTANT POINTS

#JAVA DATATYPES
-byte => A byte is an 8-bit signed integer. It has a mininmum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127 (inclusive). 
-short => A short is an 16-bit signed integer. It has a minimum value of -32768 and a maximum value of 32767 (inclusive).
-int => An int is an 32-bit signed integer. It has a minimum value of (-2)^31 and a maximum value of (2^31)-1. 
-long => A long is an 64-bit signed integer. It has a minimum value of (-2)^63 and a maximum value of (2^63)-1. 

**These four data types hold the integer values and the order of their size is as follows.
byte < short < int < long**
